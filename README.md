# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview/Purpose of Project
**Guide Louise on how to achieve a successful theater kickstarter campaign by leveraging outcome analysis of previous kickstarter campaigns based on launch month and goals($).** 

### Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
See Enclosed Chart **'Outcomes based on Launch Date'** **[https://github.com/ljlodl5/Kickstarter-Challenge/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=Theater%20Outcomes%20based%20on%20Launch%20Date.xlxs]**

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
See Enclosed Chart **'Outcomes Based on Goals** **[https://github.com/ljlodl5/Kickstarter-Challenge/blob/main/Outcomes%20vs%20Goals%20.png]**

#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Utilizing a data set of > 4k entertainment kickstarter samples, two charts have been put together to guide Louise on successful and failed campaigns.  
Some concluding challenges exist. For example, the sample set is not representative of the entire population of kickstarter campaigns. Rather this subset was chosen as a representative sample in order to provide strong correlations on how to proceed. 
Because this is a sample, it is important to note there may be risks to not examining or understanding a greater population of kickstarter campaigns and how the existing data is distributed. A box and whisker chart to evaluate central tendency and spread on the distribution of the dataset may help qualify/quantify risks to the data analysis.    
In addition, we may correlate success and failure factors but lack human retrospectives on why campaing leaders believe their campaign may have been a success or failure. 

## Results

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The most successful launch month is May and (2) December is a volatile launch month with campaigns having the largest amount of successes/failures. In sum, Louise may be best served by launching in or around May.  

**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Kickstarter campaigns less than 15k have higher chance of successful outcomes, with potential outlier activity in the 35-45k range and (2)The least successful rates occur within the 44k-44.9k goal range. 
In sum, Louise may have greater success if her campaign remains in the under 15k range as the risk of successful campaigns increases when the goal ($) is greater than 15k. 

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
Play campaigns with goals more than 25k have fewer data samples and are more difficult to draw firm conclusions.   

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
a) Success of campaigns relative to percentage funded.
b) Success of campaigns based on average backer pledge.
c) Campaign trends between years (were outside or economic factors a contributer during certain years?)
d) Campaign trends between countries (Can factors within other country success rates be applied to the US?) 

The charts above can be managed in bar and line charts. 
In addition there should be consideration for a box and whisker chart to evaluate central tendency and spread in order to understand the distribution of the dataset.
